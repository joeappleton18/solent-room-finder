This project is a proof of concept room tracking application. Over the semester, I produced this application and supporting tutorials to showcase DevOps' best practices.

- Next Auth
- React Query
- Express
- MongoDB

### DevOps

- Static code analysis
  - Prettier
  - ES Lint
- Storybook to support a component-driven development approach
- Testing
- Cypress and Jest
- CD
  - Staging and main branch auto-deploy to Vercel
- CI
  - Tests and static code analysis automatically run on push and pulls, using GitHub actions
  - Code coverage

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/joeappleton18/solent-room-finder.git`
- Next navigate into the created `solent-room-finder` folder: `cd solent-room-finder`
- Install the dependencies: `npm install`

### Setting up the database

- Get the connection string of your MongoDB server.In the case of MongoDB Atlas, it should be a string like this (notice how we've added rooms as the database name):

`mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@my-project-abc123.mongodb.net/rooms?retryWrites=true&w=majority`

- If you are running MongoDB locally, it will look something like this:

`mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/rooms`

- To get authentication working, you will need to register a GitHubOauth application. [Full instructions on how to do this can be found in the notes](https://joeappleton18.github.io/devops_2022_2023_notes/week-7/#task-0-1-get-the-starter-application).

- To allow image uploads you will require a Cloudinary account

- Copy the `.env.local.example` file in this directory to .env.local, which will be ignored by Git), an populate the variables within it
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

- Run the development server: `npm run dev`

- **If you want to see the project stories**: `npm run "storybook"`
- **If you want to run the tests**: `npm cypress:run`

## Follow the tutorials

[I have an accompanying tutorial for this project, should you want to follow along](https://joeappleton18.github.io/devops_2022_2023_notes/)
